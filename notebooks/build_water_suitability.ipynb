    "- **Title**:  Surface Water Flow\n",
    "- **Description from Source**:   This data is a representation of stream and river water bodies derived from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) and is symbolized by flow rate from gauge adjusted values from the USGS Extended Unit Runoff Method(EROM) table. The EROM table contains other mean annual flow/velocity statistics for the NHDFlowline features such as Flow from runoff or Velocity from runoff. Subject matter experts on this data agreed that for the purposes of finding flow discharge rates of cooling water for power plants, the gauge adjusted vales were the ideal empirical values for this study. It should also be noted that the flow rates were originally in Cubic feet per second (cfs) but converted to Gallons per minute (gpm).  The geospatial data sets included in NHDPlusV2 are intended to support a variety of water- related applications. They already have been used in an application to develop estimates of mean annual streamflow and velocity for each NHDFlowline feature in the conterminous United States. The results of these analyses are included with the NHDPlusV2 data. A water-quality model developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) called SPARROW (Spatially Referenced Regressions on Watershed Attributes), can utilize the NHDPlusV2 network functionality to track the downstream transport of nutrients, sediments, or other substances. NHDPlusV2 water bodies and estimates of streamflow and velocity are used in SPARROW to identify reservoir retention and in-stream loss factors. NHDPlusV2 climatic and land surface attributes can be used in SPARROW to identify potential factors in the delivery of nutrients from the land surface to streams. NHDPlusV2 data is also being used in select areas for a USGS Web-based application, called StreamStats. StreamStats provides tools to interactively select any point in the implemented areas, delineate watersheds, and to obtain streamflow and watershed characteristics for the selected point. NHDPlusV2 has been designed to accommodate many users' needs for future applications. NHDPlusV2 provides the framework and tools necessary to customize the behavior of the network relationships as well as building upon the attribute database, for which the user can assign their own data to the network.\n",
